## Overview

Cistern is an event aggregation and indexing system. Cistern consumes VPC Flow Logs and JSON events
from AWS CloudWatch Logs and exposes a SQL-like querying interface.

## Getting Started

First, download a release from [GitHub](https://github.com/Cistern/cistern/releases).
Cistern has no external dependencies and is a single binary.

Cistern accepts a few command-line flags.

* **api-addr**: Listen address for the UI and API (defaults to `localhost:2020`)
* **config**: Path to the config file (defaults to `./cistern.json`)
* **data-dir**: Data directory where Cistern saves data (defaults to `./data/`)
* **ui-content**: Path to static UI content (enables UI)

You'll have to create a config file in order to let Cistern know which CloudWatch log groups
to consume from.

#### Config file

The config file has two main options:

* **cloudwatch_logs**: A list of CloudWatch Logs log groups to consume.
* **retention**: The retention of events in days.

```json
{
  "cloudwatch_logs": [],
  "retention": 3
}
```

You can specify the log groups to consume in the config file.
In the `cloudwatch_logs` section, add an object for each log group
with the name and whether it's a flow log group.

**Example**

```json
{
  "cloudwatch_logs": [
    {
      "name": "flowlogs",
      "flowlog": true
    },
    {
      "name": "applogs",
      "flowlog": false
    }
  ],
  "retention": 3
}
```

#### Credentials

Cistern will try to use AWS credentials from the following locations:

* Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
* Shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
* EC2 Instance Role credentials

To specify the region, set the AWS_REGION environment variable.

## Using Cistern

### UI

Cistern comes with a simple UI to query events. It's accessible at
`http://api-addr/ui/`, where api-addr is the value of the command-line flag.

#### Query Language

Cistern uses a SQL-like query language. Here's an example:

```txt
SELECT sum(bytes), sum(packets)
GROUP BY source_address, dest_address
FILTER source_address neq "10.0.0.1"
ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC
LIMIT 5
POINT SIZE 1h
```

You'll notice that FILTER and POINT SIZE are keywords that aren't from SQL.

The main components of that query are:

* SELECT
* GROUP BY
* FILTER
* ORDER BY
* LIMIT
* POINT SIZE

These six components *must* be in that order. All components are optional.
The following sections of the documentation describe how the results change
depending on which components are present.

#### Events

Raw events are returned if *only* FILTER and LIMIT are defined.

#### Aggregations

Aggregations are returned when there are aggregation columns defined with
SELECT.

#### Time Series

Time series are returned when the POINT SIZE is defined. The argument passed
to POINT SIZE is a decimal number with a unit suffix. Valid time units are
`ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. If you need to set a point size
of 1 day, use `24h`.

#### Filters

Filters are applied as the first stage of query execution. A filter requires
a column name, a condition, and a value for the condition. The supported
conditions are:

* **eq**: equal
* **neq**: not equal

If multiple filters are specified, they are applied in a boolean "AND" operation.

### Retention

Cistern doesn't enforce retention automatically. You'll have to do it manually
by sending a POST request to the `/api/collections/:collection/compact` endpoint.
This will rewrite the collection and remove expired events.
